## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

More practical and comfortable use of local storage and object orientation.  

### Continued development

Need to explore constructor functions and prototypes on the next project. JavaScript was the focus for this project, so did only the barest minimum CSS.   

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
